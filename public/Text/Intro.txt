I'm a graduate of AI at Imperial College with a passion for STEM and its creative applications. As an AI trainer at Data Annotation, I get an insight into the ways LLMs are trained. As a Mixing Engineer at Imperial College, I have experience combining technical skills with creative direction to solve problems.

I consider myself a lifelong learner with a deep commitment to intellectual growth and curiosity across diverse fields. I am known for bringing a well-rounded perspective to studies and projects, with a strong ability to connect ideas across disciplines. This intellectual curiosity enhances both my personal and professional work, enabling a creative and open-minded approach to challenges.
